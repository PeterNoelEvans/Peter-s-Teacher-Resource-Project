## Media File Labeling and Robust Linking

### Problem
Previously, uploaded media files (audio, images, etc.) were renamed for uniqueness on the server, making it difficult to reliably link them to specific questions or UI elementsâ€”especially when multiple files were involved in a single assessment.

### Solution
A `label` field was added to the `MediaFile` model in the database. This field stores the original field name (e.g., `audio_0`, `image_1`) from the upload form, which is also referenced in the question data (e.g., `audioFileName`).

- When uploading files, the frontend assigns a unique field name to each file input.
- The backend saves this field name as the `label` for each uploaded file.
- When rendering assessments, the frontend matches the question's `audioFileName` (or similar) to the `label` in `mediaFiles` to display the correct file.

### Benefits
- Supports multiple media files per assessment and per question.
- Prevents mismatches and errors when rendering or grading.
- Future-proofs the system for complex activities (e.g., drag-and-drop with multiple audio prompts).

### Developer Best Practices
- Always use unique and descriptive field names for file inputs in the frontend (e.g., `audio_0`, `audio_1`, `image_0`).
- When saving files, ensure the backend stores the field name as `label` in the database.
- When rendering, always match by `label`, not by file path or substring.
- Document any new media field conventions in both backend and frontend code for clarity.
