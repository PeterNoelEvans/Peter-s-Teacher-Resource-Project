Start your dev server (npm run dev)
Log in as:
Admin: admin@example.com / adminpass
Teacher: teacher@example.com / teacherpass
Student: student@example.com / studentpass
All main components and functions should now be testable!
If you want the seed script to be re-runnable without errors, I can update it to use upsert or createMany with skipDuplicates for enrollments and submissions.
Would you like me to do that, or are you ready to test the app?
